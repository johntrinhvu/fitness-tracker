## Biggest Takeaway

During the development of this project, my biggest takeaway was the importance of following RESTful steps. It became evident that everything can break if the proper RESTful conventions are not followed. This realization highlighted the significance of adhering to these standards for robust and consistent application functionality.

Additionally, I found working with CSS to be a challenging aspect of the project. It can be complex and time-consuming to achieve the desired styling and layout. I learned that patience and attention to detail are crucial when working with CSS to ensure a visually pleasing user interface.
